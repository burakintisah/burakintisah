# CLAUDE.md

## Project Overview

This is a **GitHub Profile Repository** (`burakintisah/burakintisah`). It is a special GitHub repository whose `README.md` is displayed on the owner's GitHub profile page at `https://github.com/burakintisah`.

The repository contains no source code, build systems, or dependencies — it is purely a content repository for the GitHub profile.

## Repository Structure

```
burakintisah/
├── CLAUDE.md       # AI assistant guidance (this file)
└── README.md       # GitHub profile content (displayed on profile page)
```

## Key Files

- **README.md** — The only content file. Uses GitHub-flavored Markdown with inline HTML. This file renders directly on the GitHub profile page. Currently contains a greeting header and a commented-out template with placeholder sections.

## Technology

- **Language:** Markdown (GitHub-flavored) with inline HTML
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Build system:** None
- **Package manager:** None
- **Tests:** None
- **CI/CD:** None
- **Linting/Formatting:** None

## Development Workflow

1. Edit `README.md` directly — changes are visible on the GitHub profile after pushing to `main`.
2. No build step, compilation, or deployment is required.
3. Preview Markdown rendering locally or on GitHub to verify formatting.

## Conventions

- The README uses GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM) syntax.
- Inline HTML (e.g., `<img>` tags) is used for elements not natively supported by Markdown, such as sized images.
- Emoji shortcodes (e.g., `:wave:`) and Unicode emoji are both acceptable.
- External image assets are referenced via URL (e.g., from other GitHub repos or CDNs).

## Git Workflow

- **Default branch:** `main`
- **Remote:** `origin`
- Commit messages should be concise and describe the content change (e.g., "Update profile bio", "Add project links section").

## Common Tasks

### Update profile content
Edit `README.md` and push to `main`. No other steps needed.

### Add badges or shields
Use [Shields.io](https://shields.io) or similar services. Insert the badge Markdown/HTML into `README.md`.

### Add GitHub stats widgets
Use services like [github-readme-stats](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) and embed the generated image URLs in `README.md`.

## Notes for AI Assistants

- This is a content-only repository. Do not add package managers, build tools, or source code unless explicitly requested.
- Changes to `README.md` are immediately visible on the owner's GitHub profile once pushed to `main`.
- Keep the profile content professional and well-formatted.
- Preserve any existing structure and style choices in the README when making edits.
